# Neural Networks: Zero to Hero 

This repository contains my implementation and notes following Andrej Karpathy's "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" course. Each directory corresponds to a different section of the course.

## Course Structure

1. **micrograd**: Building neural networks and backpropagation from scratch
   
2. **makemore**: Introduction to language modeling
   
3. **makemore_part2_mlp**: Multilayer Perceptron Implementation
   
4. **makemore_part3_bn**: Activations, Gradients, and BatchNorm
   
5. **makemore_part4_backprop**: Manual Backpropagation
   
6. **makemore_part5_wavenet**: WaveNet-style Architecture
   
7. **gpt**: Building GPT From Scratch
   
8. **tokenizer**: GPT Tokenizer Implementation
